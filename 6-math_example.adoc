== Example using equations in asciidoc

You need to define the equation either as an asciimath inline macro:

asciimath:[$\frac{32\ 881\ \ 581.700504}{2^{n + 8}}$]meters/pixels

or as a delimited block:

[asciimath]
++++
[$\frac{Tsble4at60}{Table4at90} = \frac{4214.27}{4516.57} = 0.933069.$]
++++

and you can use either asciimath or latexmath macro identifiers:

latexmath:[$\frac{Tsble4at60}{Table4at90} = \frac{4214.27}{4516.57} = 0.933069.$]

Unfortunately, the preview in most tools will not display the equation correctly, see the screenshot from Atom as an example:

[#img_screenshotAtom,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']
.Screenshot from Atom editor: the preview shows the raw formular
image::images/mathAtom.png[width=600,align="center"]


...but once compiled with the stem "latexmath" being set, it works well in the html (reason is that the code is actually interpreted by the Javascript engine of the browser).

[#img_screenshotAtom,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']
.Screenshot from Browser: the formular is correctly displayed
image::images/mathBrowser.png[width=600,align="center"]

That means that the stem is not supported by the asciidoctor-pdf engine, i.e. you cannot produce pdf documents that way. We recommend that you rather use screenshots from the rendered html version for your pdf.

To compile this example, you would use

....
asciidoctor -a stem=latexmath math_example.adoc
....
