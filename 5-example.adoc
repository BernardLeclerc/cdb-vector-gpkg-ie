== IE Overview and Concept of Operations
=== IE Overview
The current approved OGC CDB 1.1 Standard provides a Best Practices document describing the encoding of vector data using Esri Shapefiles.   All previous versions of CDB (including OGC CDB Standard 1.0 and the Industry-maintained CDB Specification 3.2 and prior) have only described vector data encoding in Shapefiles.  All known CDB content and repositories that include vector data are encoded using Shapefiles.  As a result, there have been numerous requests to test and document how other vector envodings could be stored in a CDB data store.  This requirement is captured in OGC CHange Request <add CR>. Another identified issue is that every use of Shapefiles creates four physical files on storage which has performance implications.

The goal of this IE will be achieved by replicating the experimentation conducted in the Discussion Paper by IE participants who are CDB content creators, maintainers of CDB repositories, implementers of CDB datasets in run-time and non-run-time CDB use cases, or new CDB 1.1 users who are evaluating CDB implementations.

These IE participants will produce an OGC Engineering Report that discusses whether the recommended alternate encoding of CDB vector data as a GeoPackage is fit for use and submission to the OGC for consideration as an approved change to the OGC CDB 1.1 Standard and/or Best Practices.

=== IE Experiments
Experiment #1

The methodology involves:

   * Acquisition of sample dataset(s) provided for the IE.
   * Use of provided open-source software to modify each sample dataset according to the three technical alternatives.  
   * Consensus and provision of baseline (unmodified) and three alternative encoding datasets.
   * Evaluate process and provide feedback on conversions resulting from Experiment #1.

Experiment #2

The methodology involves:

   * Modifying implementation software according to Alternative #1.
   * Replace each Shapefile, consolidating the three geometry files with a single GeoPackage.
   * Evaluate and compare performance using the baseline CDB datasets and the Alternative #1 datasets.
   * Evaluate analysis and results from Experiment #2  for performance, backwards-compatibility and risks to interoperability.

Experiment #3

The methodology involves: 

   * Modifying implementation software according to Alternative #2.
   * Store each CDB LOD as a layer in GeoPackage
   * Evaluate and compare performance using the baseline CDB datasets and the Alternative #2 datasets.
   * Evaluate analysis and results from Experiment #3 for performance, backwards-compatibility and risks to interoperability.

Experiment #4

The methodology involves:

   * Modifying implementation software according to Alternative #3.
   * Store each Geocell of Vector Data as a layer in GeoPackage (extends Alternative #3 to have a single GeoPackage per Geocell of CDB, with all LODs and all CDB feature layers).
   * Evaluate and compare performance using the baseline CDB datasets and the Alternative #3 datasets.
   * Evaluate analysis and results from Experiment #4 for performance, backwards-compatibility and risks to interoperability.

[NOTE]
.Instructions
===============================================
This section explains some concepts frequently required by Asciidoc novices. Please use this file as a template for your own clauses.
===============================================

=== Figures
If you want to reference a figure by using a figure number, it is important to use the following syntax. The figure identifier for <<img_mindMap>> is the first statement of the header. Please adapt the width as appropriate.

[#img_mindMap,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']
.High-Level Mind Map of Testbed-14
image::images/t14MindMap.png[width=800,align="center"]

It is important that you use the same syntax for all images, otherwise the automatic numbering is corrupted!

=== Tables
Tables are easy to deal with as long as you keep them simple! To add a table, please use the following syntax.

[#table_countries,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
.Countries in Europe
[cols="50e,^25m,>25s",width="75%",options="header",align="center"]
|===
|Country | Population | Size

| Monaco
| 36371
| 1.98

| Gibraltar
| 29431
| 6.8
|===

The first line is used for referencing. You can reference <<table_countries>> in your text. The only thing you should change in that line is the table id, which is "table_countries" in this case. Please do not remove the "#", please do not change anything else in that line.

You can define the style and width of each column. In our example, the first column takes 50% of the entire width, the second and third column take 25% each. The total width of the table is 75% of the text width.

The letters after the width percentage indicate if the column is e=emphasis, m=monospaced, a=asciidoc, s=strong. The d=default does not need to be set.

Cell alignment: If you need to align a column, you may indicate this by setting ^,<, or >. Examples:

* ^25m = centered, 25% width, monospaced.
* >25e = aligned right, 25% width, emphasised
* <25 = aligned left, 25% width, asciidoc

In any case, please make sure that your table fit on a piece of A4 or letter-size paper!!

[[RecommendedAsciidocEnvironment]]
=== Recommended Asciidoc Environment

We recommend to use http://asciidoctor.org[asciidoctor] and http://asciidoctor.org/docs/convert-asciidoc-to-pdf/[asciidoctor-pdf] in combination with the https://atom.io[Atom] editor.

==== Installation on MacOS and Linux
. Please follow the steps on https://asciidoctor.org/#installation.
. Install the bibtex extension: _gem install asciidoctor-bibtex_


==== Installation on Windows
We have made best experiences with the following steps:

. Install ruby for windows: https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/. If you experience any issues, the following link may help: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18908708/installing-ruby-gem-in-windows[stackoverflow]

. Open command prompt and install two gems:
.. Execute: "gem install asciidoctor"
.. Execute: "gem install asciidoctor-bibtex"

. Text your installation
.. Open a folder that contains your Engineering Report asciidoc source files, including the _er.adoc_ file.
.. Execute the following command: _asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-bibtex er.adoc_

==== Using Asciidoctor with Atom
In Atom, you should install the following packages:

* asciidoc-preview
* autocomplete-asciidoc
* language-asciidoc
* markdown-writer: requires changing of key-map to allow for keyboard shortcuts such as e.g. *bold*
* platformio-IDE-terminal

This environment allows you to use keyboard shortcuts, autocomplete, syntax highlighting and a rendered preview for asciidoc; and provides you an terminal window within the editor to convert your asciidoc to html and pdf.

=== Asciidoc Conversion
In order to achieve a uniform look-and-feel of all ERs in both HTML and PDF, we have provided a css and theme file. The following commands can be used to convert the ER:

*Command for PDF output:*
 asciidoctor-pdf -r asciidoctor-bibtex -a pdf-stylesdir=resources -a pdf-style=ogc -a pdf-fontsdir=resources/fonts er.adoc

*Command for HTML output:*
asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-bibtex -a linkcss -a stylesheet=rocket-panda.css -a stylesdir=./stylesheets er.adoc

=== Source Code

You can add code snippets using the following syntax:

.Code Example XML
[source,xml]
----
<section>
  <title>Section Title</title> <!--1-->
</section>
----
<1> This notation allows to reference particular sections within the code.

You can alternatively use line numbers to reference a specific section in your code.


.Code Example JSON
[source,json,linenumbers]
----
{"menu": {
  "id": "file",
  "value": "File",
  "popup": {
    "menuitem": [
      {"value": "New", "onclick": "CreateNewDoc()"},
      {"value": "Open", "onclick": "OpenDoc()"},
      {"value": "Close", "onclick": "CloseDoc()"}
    ]
  }
}}
----

As shown in line 2, the value of "id" is "File".

=== Asciidoc(tor) Syntax Help
